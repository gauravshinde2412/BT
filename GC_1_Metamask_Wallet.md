### Blockchain Basics

1. **Blockchain**: A decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions in a secure, immutable, and transparent way. Each "block" contains a list of transactions, and blocks are linked together in a "chain" using cryptography.

2. **Decentralization**: The absence of a central authority. In a decentralized system, control and decision-making are distributed among all participants, making the system more secure and resistant to censorship.

3. **Consensus Mechanism**: A process used by blockchain networks to validate and agree on transactions. Popular consensus mechanisms include:
   - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Used by Bitcoin, where miners solve complex cryptographic problems to validate transactions.
   - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Used by Ethereum, where validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they “stake” as collateral.

4. **Node**: A computer that participates in the blockchain network. Nodes store a copy of the blockchain, validate transactions, and relay information across the network.

5. **Smart Contract**: A self-executing contract with the terms directly written into code. Smart contracts run on the blockchain, automating and enforcing agreements without needing intermediaries.

6. **Token**: A digital asset or unit of value on a blockchain. Tokens can represent assets, utility, or governance rights in a decentralized application. Common types are **fungible tokens** (e.g., ERC-20) and **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** (e.g., ERC-721).

### Transaction Terms

1. **Transaction**: A record of movement or transfer of assets (like cryptocurrency) between two parties on a blockchain. Transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the blockchain.

2. **Gas Fee**: The fee paid to miners or validators for processing and validating a transaction on the blockchain. On Ethereum, for example, gas fees are paid in Ether (ETH) and vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity.

3. **Nonce**: A unique number that increments with each transaction sent from a wallet. Nonces help ensure that transactions are processed in the correct order and prevent double-spending.

4. **Hash**: A fixed-length string generated by a cryptographic algorithm (like SHA-256 in Bitcoin) to uniquely represent data. Each block and transaction on a blockchain is hashed, creating a unique identifier that makes it easy to verify data integrity.

5. **Block Time**: The average time taken to create a new block in a blockchain. For example, Bitcoin’s block time is around 10 minutes, while Ethereum’s is around 12–14 seconds.

6. **Block Height**: The number of blocks in a blockchain, counted from the genesis (first) block. It represents the "depth" of a block in the chain, which increases with each new block added.

### Wallet Terms

1. **Wallet**: A digital tool for managing and storing cryptocurrencies or tokens. Wallets allow users to send, receive, and view balances. Wallets can be software-based (e.g., MetaMask) or hardware-based (e.g., Ledger).

2. **Private Key**: A secret cryptographic key that allows the holder to access and control the cryptocurrency in their wallet. Losing the private key usually means losing access to the wallet permanently, so it must be kept safe.

3. **Public Key**: A cryptographic key derived from the private key. It is publicly shared and used to generate wallet addresses. The public key is a unique identifier for the wallet but does not reveal the private key.

4. **Address**: A unique string of characters derived from the public key and used to receive cryptocurrency. It’s like a bank account number but is publicly visible on the blockchain.

5. **Seed Phrase**: A set of randomly generated words that serves as a backup for a wallet. The seed phrase can regenerate the private key, allowing access to the wallet if lost. Commonly, it’s a 12- or 24-word phrase.

6. **Custodial Wallet**: A wallet managed by a third-party service (like an exchange), which controls the private keys on behalf of the user. This means the service is responsible for securing assets but also has control over them.

7. **Non-Custodial Wallet**: A wallet where users control their private keys. Non-custodial wallets give users full ownership of their assets but require them to manage their security.

### Security and Utility Terms

1. **Multisig Wallet (Multisignature Wallet)**: A wallet that requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. Multisig wallets are used for added security and are common in organizations where multiple people must approve transactions.

2. **Cold Wallet**: A wallet that is not connected to the internet, like a hardware wallet or paper wallet, making it more secure against hacking. Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage.

3. **Hot Wallet**: A wallet that is always connected to the internet, like an app or web-based wallet. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent transactions but are more vulnerable to security risks.

4. **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction. On Ethereum, if the gas limit is too low, the transaction may fail and result in the user losing the paid fees.

5. **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: An organization managed by smart contracts and governed by its members, typically through a voting mechanism using tokens. DAOs allow for decentralized decision-making and management.
